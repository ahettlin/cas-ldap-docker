CAS Docker Overlay
==================
Uses gradle to build CAS 6.x 

# Docker Compose setup using a multi-stage build:
* First stage builds a Docker image that:
  * clones https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template
  * copies the src (local overlay) tree into it
  * builds cas.war
* Second stage runs CAS in a Docker container
  * copies the directory etc/cas into the container at /etc/cas
  * generates a self-signed keystore for CAS to use at startup
  * copies the cas.war file from the first stage
  * exposes port 8443
  * runs /usr/bin/java -jar cas.war (using the embedded Tocmat server)

To use
=====
* To build & run CAS in Docker type:
```docker-compose up --force-recreate```. If you have changed anything in the Dockerfile, application.yml, or .env files, use this instead ```docker-compose up --force-recreate --build cas```. If you want to be able to close the terminal and keep the container running, add the ```-d``` argument.

* Open up a page at https://localhost:8443/cas/login and login as:
  * user: ${username from .env}
  * password: ${password from .env}

* Type ctrl-c to exit (if not using ```-d```), then type this to cleanup:
```docker-compose down --rmi all```

Notes
=====
If you want to grab a copy of the cas.war file that is running in the container use the 'docker cp' command, for example:
```
wishbringer:~ $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                  PORTS                    NAMES

wishbringer:~ $ docker cp 79e44dd14c7e:/root/cas.war .
wishbringer:~ $ ls -l cas.war
-rw-r--r--  1 crpeck  staff  91251638 Aug 15 14:40 cas.war
```

The end result is an image of about 173MB that has a full implementation of CAS.
```
REPOSITORY             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
casoverlaydocker_cas   latest              954457811c53        18 seconds ago      173MB
```

Proxy authentication
====================

In order to get the proxy authentication working, you need to make sure that the container has imported your SSL
certificate (self signed or not).

Your certificate needs to be setup for a local host on your machine.

## Step 1

Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  cas:
    extra_hosts:
      - "casclient:172.22.0.1"
```

Change `casclient` and `172.22.0.1` based on your host settings.

On my side `casclient` is the hostname of CAS client application and `172.22.0.1` is the IP of the host running Docker.

## Step 2

Copy the SSL certificate from your application into `etc/cas/config/certificate.pem`.

The format of the certificate must be in `PEM`.

## Step 3

`docker-compose up`

or 

`docker-compose up --force-recreate --build`
